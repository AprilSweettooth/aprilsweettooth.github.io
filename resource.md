## Resources

- PartII physicists pretend to be a Mathmos:
    - Electrodynamics taught in a more fundamental way by [Dr.Adhikari]({{ site.url }}/public/assets/notes/electro.pdf)
    - Statistical field theory by [Dr.ChristopherThomas]({{ site.url }}/public/assets/notes/sft.pdf), good for TP1 and thermostatistcs course
    - Symmetries, Fields and Particles by [Dr.MatthewWingate]({{ site.url }}/public/assets/notes/sfp.pdf) needs some maths intuitions
    - Funniest lecturer on Fluid dynamics [Prof.EricLauga]({{ site.url }}/public/assets/notes/fluid.pdf)
    - Dr Christopher Lester's particle physics, it's a [show](https://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/~lester/teaching/partIIIparticles/welcome.html)
    - Supersymmetry and Duality by [Prof.DavidTong]({{ site.url }}/public/assets/notes/susy.pdf) where the beauty of physics presented
    - Topological Quantum Matter Prof.B.Beri, Steven's book (below) explains everything
    - The Standard Model [Prof.Quevedo]({{ site.url }}/public/assets/notes/fluid.pdf), good starting points for theoretical physics
    - Black holes by [DrJ.E.Santos]({{ site.url }}/public/assets/notes/bh.pdf), good revision course for GR (topic 10 onwards)
    - Field theory in Cosmology [Dr.E.Pajer]({{ site.url }}/public/assets/notes/field_theory_in_Cosmology.pdf), very interesting
    - Advanced Quantum Field Theory [Dr.R.A.Reid-Edwards]({{ site.url }}/public/assets/notes/AQFTNotes.pdf), never seen QFT explained this thorough and clear
