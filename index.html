title: About
---

<p>I am a third-year physics student at Peterhouse, University of Cambridge. My research interests revolve around quantum computing.

    Prior to my University, I attended <a href="https://www.shrewsbury.org.uk/">Shrewsbury School</a>.
    
    I love all kinds of technology and enjoy cybersecurity research a lot. I am open for collaboration.
    
    I participate from time to time CTFs in my free time.</p>
