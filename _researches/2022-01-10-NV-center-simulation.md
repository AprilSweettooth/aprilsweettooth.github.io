# Simulations on NV centers

- Simulate NV center quantum system with MATLAB: dipolar interaction/ Octahedra lattice
-  Using Qutip simulate microwave ODMR line broadening. And use it to calculate T2 relaxation time
- Add dephasing interaction like hyperfine structure in the quantum system
- Controlled rabi oscillation between seven-level system and two-level approximated system
- (to be updated)
